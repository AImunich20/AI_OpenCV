# YOLOv8 Object Detection with OpenCV and OpenVINO

This project demonstrates how to use YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) for object detection with OpenCV and OpenVINO to achieve efficient inference on edge devices.

---

## Features

- **YOLOv8 Integration**: Leverages Ultralytics' YOLOv8 model for accurate object detection.
- **OpenVINO Optimization**: Uses Intel OpenVINO for faster inference on supported hardware.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Streamlines object detection from live video feeds or static images.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify and adapt for various use cases.

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.10.8(good) or newer
- OpenCV (v4.7 or newer)
- OpenVINO Development Tools
- Ultralytics YOLOv8 (`pip install ultralytics`)
- Pytorch GPU Nvidia using (`pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124`)
